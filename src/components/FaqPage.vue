                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Battle Teams consist of 3 of your Kitties. You can have a maximum of 3 Battle Teams, but only need 1 team to play. Kitties can be added or retired from your Battle Teams. If you retire a Kitty from a Battle Team, you will not be able to add them to another team for 7 days.</p>
                            <p>You will pick your team from your linked wallet.  You can have up to 3 Battle Teams, so you can fill your Team Roster with up to 9 Kitties.  Mix and match these kitties to maximize your team’s potential.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>When you “retire” a kitten, that kitten simply returns to your wallet for 7 days.  The kitty will retain all XP and SP acquired, so when they return to battle they will not have to start over.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>When you sell a Battle Kitten, that kitten will retain all XP and SP earned while in your care.  So battle those “shit cats” to make them the most sought after kitties in the Kittyverse.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Kitty Origins are determined by the Fur catribute of your CryptoKitty and cannot be changed.  Every CyptoKitty fits within a Kitty Origin and each Kitty Origin has unique enhancements to their Battle Skills.</p>
                            <p>There are 8 Kitty Origins: Arctic, Desert, Jungle, City, Mountain, Plains, Seaside, & Space. <a href="OriginPage.vue"> Click here to learn which kitty belongs to which origin</a>!</p>

                            <p>As you battle, your Kitties will gain both Experience Points (XP) and Battle Points (BP). Once a Kitty earns enough XP, they will level up and earn a Skill Point. Skill Points can be used to level up acquired Battle Skills.  Battle Points are a form of currency that you can spend to play in the Battle Arena.</p>
